# Pokemon Amethyst Helper

Pokemon Amethyst Helper is a web based utility designed to support people playing the Pokemon Amethyst Romhack.

It's secondary purpose is to serve as a way for me to learn more about React, and was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

Run the app by running `npm run dev`. The server will be hosted at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.
